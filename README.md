FLEXI is a high-order numerical framework for solving PDEs, with a focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics. FLEXI is based on the Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM), which allows for high-order of accuracy and fully unstructured hexahedral meshes.
The solver is parallelized very efficiently and scales up to hundreds of thousand cores.

For the main development branch, see [flexi-framework/flexi](https://github.com/flexi-framework/flexi). This repository contains an extension of FLEXI towards particle-laden flows. The particle tracking approach operates in physical space and is based on methods from ray-tracing to handle intersections with possibly curved boundaries. Particles are implemented with a Lagrangian point-particle ansatz and can either be one- or two-way coupled to the fluid phase. Particle-wall interactions are handled via a hard-sphere approach, where multiple models are available. 

For details on the available models and implementation, see our paper in [Computer Physics Communications](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2023.108762) or the manuscript on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05458).

FLEXI has been developed by the [Numerics Research Group (NRG)][nrg] led by Prof. Claus-Dieter Munz at the Institute of Aerodynamics and Gasdynamics at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

This is a scientific project. If you use FLEXI for publications or presentations in science, please support the project by citing our publications given in [references](REFERENCE.md).

# About

[FLEXI][flexi] is a high-order numerical framework for solving PDEs, with a special focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics.
[FLEXI][flexi] is based on the Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM), which allows for high-order of accuracy 
and fully unstructured hexahedral meshes. The solver is parallelized very efficiently for large-scale applications and
scales to 500,000+ cores. Moreover, [FLEXI][flexi] comes with a capable pre- and postprocessing suite that enables complex
simulation setups up to the finished visualization.

[FLEXI][flexi] has been developed by the [Numerics Research Group (NRG)][nrg] founded by Prof. Claus-Dieter Munz and currently
lead by Prof. Andrea Beck at the Institute of Aerodynamics and Gasdynamics at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

# Quick Start Guide
For a more detailed installation instructions, please see the documention [here][userguide].

FLEXI is tested for various Linux distributions including Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, CentOS or Arch and also runs on MacOS.
For installation you require the following dependencies:

| Package          | Required | Installed by FLEXI |
|:-----------------|:--------:|:------------------:|
| Git              |      x   |                    |
| CMake            |      x   |                    |
| C/C++ Compiler   |      x   |                    |
| Fortran Compiler |      x   |                    |
| LAPACK           |      x   |      x             |
| HDF5             |      x   |      x             |
| MPI              |     (x)  |                    |

The MPI library is only required for running parallel simulations on multiple ranks and the HDF5 and LAPACK libraries
can be installed automatically during the FLEXI build process.
The names of the packages and the package manager might differ depending on the specific distribution used.

### Getting the code
Open a terminal, download FLEXI via git and optionally export the FLEXI directory:

    git clone https://github.com/flexi-framework/flexi.git
    export FLEXI_DIR="$(pwd)/flexi"

### Compiling the code
Enter the FLEXI directory, create a build directory and use CMake to configure and compile the code

    cd $FLEXI_DIR
    mkdir build; cd build
    cmake ../
    make

The executable `flexi` is now contained in the FLEXI directory in `build/bin/`.
Custom configurations of the compiler options, dependencies and code features can be set using

    ccmake ../

### Running the code
Navigate to the directory of the tutorial **cavity** and run FLEXI

    cd $FLEXI_DIR/tutorials/cavity
    $FLEXI_DIR/build/bin/flexi parameter_flexi.ini
